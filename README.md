## Description 📝

An application which can dynamically show the weather of the users current location (if they accept to share their information).

The user can search for any city in the world in order to see what the weather conditions are like there

When the weather is displayed they are shown a card showing todays weather, which shows:

- The city name
- An icon showing the general weather conditions
- The temperature
-

### User Story 👤

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

### What did I Learn 🏫

For this project I kept strictly to the user requirements. I wanted to add more functionality, which I may do so in the future.

I've learned an awful lot about using jQuery and Bootstrap.

Specifically I learned:

- how to manipulate elements using jQuery, whether that's selecting, appending or removing etc.
- Quickly style elements using bootstrap to rapidly build sites
